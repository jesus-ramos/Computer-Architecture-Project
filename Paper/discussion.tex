Depending on the type of SSD used for a cache device this mechanism
can range from no overhead at all to as high as a 25\% to 50\%
reduction in throughput. The Vertex SSD far outperformed the Mtron SSD
in terms of writes and thus was able to mask the overhead of our
persistence mechanism by using internal hardware write
optimizations. The Mtron SSD shows results of what could be considered
our worst case scenario because, as stated previously, the Mtron SSD's
write performance far trails that of the Vertex SSD. This is another
consideration that can be used when determining whether to use our
metadata persistence scheme as the choice of SSD manufacturer will
affect performance.
