Depending on the type of SSD used for a cache device this mechanism
can range from almost no overhead at all to as high as a 25\% to 50\%
reduction in throughput. The Vertex SSD far outperformed the Mtron SSD
in terms of writes and thus was able to mask the overhead of our
persistence mechanism by using internal hardware write
optimizations. Results for the Vertex SSD tests are not shown because
they were only preliminary tests and we did not have access to the
hardware for long enough to produce significant results. The Mtron SSD
shows results of what could be considered our worst case scenario
because, as stated previously, the Mtron SSD's write performance far
trails that of the Vertex SSD. This is another consideration that can
be used when determining whether to use our metadata persistence
scheme as the choice of SSD manufacturer will affect performance.

In systems where failures are expected and happen more often the
performance hit may be more acceptable as when failures do occur there
are less requests to central storage as the recently used blocks will
be present on the cache device and you start off with higher initial
throughput which means you don't have to spend time warming up the
cache again. Another added benefit of this is that you get minimal
data loss which makes error recovery less expensive.
