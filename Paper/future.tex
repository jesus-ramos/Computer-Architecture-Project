\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

While our approach to handling metadata writes is quite naive in it's
implementation and simply a proof of concept, there are more efficient
ways to handle writing metadata to SSD's such as the FD-Tree
structure~\cite{FD-Tree} and Flash B-tree's~\cite{FlashB-Tree}. Both
of these data structures lead to similar improvements in random write
throughput, lower energy consumption, and more efficient handling of
write-wearing. We plan on extending our current approach with this
work for more efficient metadata persistence mechanisms.

We can make the overhead costs and how often metadata should be
persisted variable values depending on how tolerant the system should
be or what the acceptable overhead is for maintaining consistency
between the cache and its metadata. This way it is more applicable to
more workloads which may fall under tighter data constraints.

Although our current implementation had issues with write back it's
possible that this would benefit from fault tolerance as well. In
cases where there is a system failure and you currently have dirty
blocks in the cache this could mean data loss but if the metadata
representing those blocks could be recovered then the dirty blocks
could be written back without loss of data.
