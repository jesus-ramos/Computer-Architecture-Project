\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

While our approach to handling metadata writes is quite naive in it's
implementation and simply a proof of concept, there are more efficient
ways to handle writing metadata to SSD's such as the FD-Tree
structure~\cite{FD-Tree} and Flash B-tree's~\cite{FlashB-Tree}. Both
of these data structures lead to similar improvements in random write
throughput, lower energy consumption, and more efficient handling of
write-wearing. We plan on extending our current approach with this
work for more efficient metadata persistence mechanisms.
