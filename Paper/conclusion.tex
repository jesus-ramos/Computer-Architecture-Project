\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we created and implemented a basic mechanism within
DM-Cache to persist metadata to the cache device and allow for
recovery in the case of system failure. Our experimental results show
the overhead cost of this mechanism is outweighed by its usefulness in
cache recovery. Our scheme helps alleviate network traffic by
recovering recently used blocks and also reduces system latency when
bringing a system node back online.
