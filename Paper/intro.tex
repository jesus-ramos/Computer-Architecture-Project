\section{Introduction}

We have designed and implemented fault tolerance mechanisms in the
Linux kernel module DM-Cache~\cite{DM-Cache}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the following
section we provide background information on block level caching
mechanisms present in the Linux kernel. Section~\ref{sec:related}
discusses related work and current approaches to fault tolerance in
enterprise level systems. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} details the
design and implementation of our fault tolerance mechanism in
DM-Cache. In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we present our test setup
and evaluation of our implemented mechanism with various I/O
benchmarks as well as overhead costs. Our discussion and future work
is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and
Section~\ref{sec:future} respectively and we conclude in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
