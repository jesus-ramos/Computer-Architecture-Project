\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We have implemented metadata persistence on the latest version of
DM-Cache running on Linux kernel version 3.3. To evaluate this we use
the workloads offered by the IOZone benchmark to evaluate the overhead
of this mechanism.

We use two testing machines and iSCSI and assign one of the machines
to be the client and the other the storage target using Open-iSCSI.

Due to issues with the implementation of the write-back mechanism
within DM-Cache we only show evaluation of DM-Cache using
write-through. Our testing shows no issues with the actual data when
running experiments but the kernel logs show some issues
\textcolor{red}{that bit cleared thingy} so we omit those results.
