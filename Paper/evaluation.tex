\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We have implemented metadata persistence on the latest version of
DM-Cache running on Linux kernel version 3.3. To evaluate this we use
the workloads offered by the IOZone benchmark to evaluate the overhead
of this mechanism.

We use two testing machines and iSCSI and assign one of the machines
to be the client and the other the storage target using Open-iSCSI. We
evaluated our approach on two different SSD's, an Mtron Pro 7500 64GB
and a \textcolor{red}{whatever that vertex one is}.

Due to issues with the implementation of the write-back mechanism
within DM-Cache we only show evaluation of DM-Cache using our
persistence mechanism with write-through. Our testing shows no issues
with the actual data when running experiments but the kernel logs show
some file-system warnings so we omit those results.
